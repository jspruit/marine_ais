# The dimension A should be in the direction of the transmitted
# heading information (bow)
# Reference point of reported position not available, but
# dimensions of ship are available: A = C = 0 and B 0 and D 0.
# Neither reference point of reported position nor dimensions of
# ship available; A = B = C = D = 0 (= default).
# For use in the message table, A = most significant field,
# D = least significant field.

# reference point and dimensions should converted to an outline
# following REP103 conventions. So A is positive x, B is negative x,
# C is positive y and D is negative y.
# The outline should look like a simple ship, with the bow being
# "pointy".
